### Stats

<details>
 <summary><h3>How i got here</h3></summary>
   I was born in Russia. At the age of 9, I began to get involved in politics. This was the reason for my, one might say, forced communication with older people than me, thanks to which I learned more than the average person knew at my age. As a result of communication with older people, I formed my views on the world: the main values, aspirations in life, and so on. This resulted in the fact that I was more and more striving to earn more money and leave Russia. And my main values, by the way, are honesty and reason. It's hard to live where, when watching TV, you expect to strain your brain to remember some useful information, but instead you strain your brain to distinguish stuffing from manipulation of statistics and other things.
Until the age of 14, my views continued to form, I read a large number of financial books, and when planning how to leave here, I realized that the sooner the better. I am from a poor family, so my mother will definitely not help me with money, which means I need to earn it myself in order to leave for Europe as a student. That is why I have been learning programming since January 2023 (the first attempts were in the spring of 2022).
